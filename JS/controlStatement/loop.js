/*
A loop in JavaScript is a statement block that repeatedly executes a statement or a series of statements,
while a particular condition is true or until a specific condition becomes true.

In other words, loop statement is a control flow statement that executes a block of statements
repeatedly until a termination condition met.

In brief, a loop statement executes the same block of statements repeatedly.

The block of statements can execute many times, from zero to infinite number depending on the requirement.
Each execution of the loop is called iteration in JavaScript.

// Loop Control Structure in JavaScript
/*
A block of statements executes sequentially in the loop until a specific condition for
the termination of the loop met. Therefore, a loop control structure comprises two parts:

        * Control statement
        * Body of the loop

The work of control statement is to evaluate (i.e. test) a certain condition and
then perform the repeated execution of statements in the block of loop.

We can classify a control structure into two types depending on
the position of control statement in the loop. They are:

        * Entry-controlled loop
        * Exit-controlled loop

// Basic Steps to Process Loops in JavaScript
/*
    * Setting and initialization of a counter.
    * Execution of statements sequentially in the body/block of loop.
    * Evaluate for a specified condition for the execution of loop.
    * Incrementing the counter.

// Types of Loops in JavaScript
/*
    * Simple loops
    * Nested loops
    * Infinite loops
