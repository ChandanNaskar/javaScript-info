    * The condition or expression evaluates at the end of loop rather than the beginning.
        This means that the body of loop always executes at least once.

// Initialization:

1. The body of the loop is executed at first. Then the condition is evaluated.
2. If the condition evaluates to true, the body of the loop inside the do statement is executed again.
3. The condition is evaluated once again.
4. If the condition evaluates to true, the body of the loop inside the do statement is executed again.
5. This process continues until the condition evaluates to false. Then the loop stops.

( Note: do...while loop is similar to the while loop. The only difference is that in doâ€¦while loop,
the body of loop is executed at least once. )

(Here, the do...while loop continues until the user enters a negative number.
When the number is negative, the loop terminates; the negative number is not added to the sum variable.)
