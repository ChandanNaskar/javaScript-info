/*
In the previous tutorial so far, we learned all binary operators and ternary operators.
JavaScript also provides unary operators that requires only single variable.

Unary operators in JavaScript are those operators that works on a single operand,
which may be variable or literal.

In other simple words, unary operators are operators that have a single operand.

For example, to assign two variables with different values containing positive or negative signs,
the statements are:

let x = -10; // Assign 'x' x negative 10.
let y = +20; // Assign 'y' y positive 20 (the plus is not required).

(Arithmetic operators can also be done on a single operand using unary operators. For example,
the statement x = x + 1 has the same result as expression x++.)
